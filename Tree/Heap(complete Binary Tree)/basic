1.Heap is An Array but behind the scene complete binary tree(All levels are filled except possibly the last level and last level is filled from left to right without gaps)
2.max heap( always return max value)->Root Node is always greater or equalt to child Node.In Array, 0 index is max
3.min heap(always return min value)-> Root Node is always smaller or equal to child Node.In Array,0 index is min.
4.No sorting in array.better than using sorting function when contineously max value is required.
